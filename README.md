# Circuit Trainer

It can be difficult to keep up with your physical health while being stuck at home during the coronavirus pandmeic. 
Possibly the best way to keep the same intensity as you would in a normal gym session is to implement circuit training.

Circuit Trainer allows you to build a circuit workout to keep you in shape during this quarantine period. 
Customize your own circuit workout by setting timers for exercise and rest periods, and a buzzer will sound when each period is up.
If you're feeling like you need a break, hit the pause button and resume when ready.
